            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began as a small gathering of software developers and technology enthusiasts over a decade ago. 
                What started as a single-day meetup has grown into a multi-day international conference that brings 
                together leaders from across the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, TechCon has expanded its focus from traditional software engineering topics to include 
                emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, cloud-native architectures, cybersecurity, and data science.
                Each edition of TechCon builds on the last, fostering a community of continuous learning and innovation.
